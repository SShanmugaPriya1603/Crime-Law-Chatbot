## Gen AI Concepts Used

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Uses **LLaMA-based models** (like LLaMA2) for language understanding and legal reasoning.
- Accessed via **Groq's low-latency API infrastructure**.

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- Carefully designed system prompt instructs the model to act like a criminal law expert.
- Ensures answers:
  - Are legally relevant
  - Mention IPC sections where applicable
  - Use simple and clear language

### 3. API-based Model Inference
- Groq API is used to query LLaMA models hosted in the cloud.
- No local GPU or model hosting needed.
